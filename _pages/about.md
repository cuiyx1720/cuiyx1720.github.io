<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

👋 I am a PhD student in the [HEAD Lab](https://github.com/TJHuangteam/HEAD/) of Tongji University, affiliated with the Institute of Intelligent Vehicles (TJU-IIV), advised by [Prof. Yanjun Huang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=r_XUM78AAAAJ). I received my bachelor’s degree from Jilin University with the honor of Outstanding Graduate.
My research focuses on the continual evolution and reasoning of autonomous systems, empowering them to self-upgrade and interact intelligently in complex scenarios.
